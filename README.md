## Project Overview
This repository contains course work, assignments, and projects related to Data Mining. It includes implementations, notebooks, datasets (where permitted), reports, and examples that demonstrate core data-mining concepts and algorithms such as preprocessing, clustering, classification, association rules, and evaluation techniques.

Repository: https://github.com/vaiishhu/Data_Mining

## Contents
- `data/` - raw and (if allowed) processed datasets used in assignments and projects
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks demonstrating analyses, experiments, and visualizations
- `src/` or `code/` - Python scripts and modules implementing algorithms and utilities
- `reports/` - lab reports, summaries, and project write-ups
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `README.md` - this file

> Note: Folder names may vary slightly; check the repository root to see the exact structure.

## Key Features / Topics Covered
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, normalization, encoding)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
- Classification algorithms (k-NN, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Association rule learning (Apriori / FP-Growth)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Model evaluation and validation (cross-validation, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ recommended
- Typical Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy
  - jupyterlab or notebook

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaiishhu/Data_Mining.git
   cd Data_Mining
   ```
2. Install dependencies (see above).
3. Launch Jupyter Lab / Notebook to open and run notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
4. Or run scripts directly:
   ```bash
   python src/example_script.py
   ```

## Example workflow
- Inspect datasets in `data/`
- Run EDA notebooks in `notebooks/` to understand features and distributions
- Execute algorithm notebooks or scripts in `code/` or `src/`
- Check results and plots saved to `reports/` or `outputs/`

## Data sources & licensing
- Where datasets are included, their source and licenses are noted in the corresponding dataset folder or notebook.
- Do not redistribute datasets that are not permitted for redistribution. Replace sensitive or restricted datasets with placeholders or links to the original source.

## Contributing
- If you want to contribute, please open an issue describing your proposed change or improvement.
- Follow code style used in the repository and include tests or notebooks demonstrating your changes.
